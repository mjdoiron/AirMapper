AirMapper is the first iOS App built specifically for controlling electronic tabletop RPG maps. AirMapper is designed for the increasing number of gaming tables with built in [TVs](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/33/45/2d/33452d4a5fc152a289e1322a7a823194.jpg) and [projectors](https://imgur.com/a/2asnv) for displaying digital maps.
